<h3>The Project</h3>
For almost any data set, the measurements you calculate will need to be described in more detail than you can or should sneak into the spreadsheet. The code book contains this information. At minimum it should contain:
Information about the variables (including units!) in the data set not contained in the tidy data
Information about the summary choices you made
Information about the experimental study design you used
